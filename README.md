# personnelManagement

## Description

  This is my second PHP project created for study purposes. It was used raw CSS and PHP in this project and displayed data was created using `MySQL workbench`.Assigned and completed tasks:
  * Create DB schema with tables and data in it with relations (in this case: 1:M relation);
  * Display DB schema tables data with their relations into browser using PHP;
  * Create Delete and Update functionality: Delete and Update in browser should work in DB tables too;
  * Create Creation functionality: It is needed to be able to create new employee and new project in browser tables, and theese data should be set in DB schema too;
  * It is needed to be able to assign an employee to a project and this assigment sets in DB schema too;
  * Use 'prepared statements' into code;
